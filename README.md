## What We're Doing
### We're building a modern authorization server to authenticate your users and protect your APIs.

#### You can find professional services and sponsor information on [our website](http://anvil.io).

#### Simplified Security
- Share user accounts between multiple apps and services with Single Sign-On (shared sessions)
- Issue signed JSON Web Tokens to protect your APIs
- Be a federated identity provider with OpenID Connect
- Enable third-party developers using two- and three-legged OAuth 2.0

#### Flexible User Authentication
- Use local passwords, OAuth 1.0, OAuth 2.0, OpenID, LDAP, Active Directory, and more
- Works out of the box with Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, and a [growing list of providers](https://github.com/christiansmith/anvil-connect/tree/master/providers)
- Custom schemes using virtually any existing Passport.js strategy or your own code

#### Make it yours
- Brand the interface with your own design
- Use middleware hooks for domain specific implementations
- Keep your changes under version control without forking

#### Standard, Interoperable, and Open Source
- Language and platform agnostic
- Implements widely accepted, well-understood protocols
- MIT license



## Get Started

#### Requirements

The CLI tools require recent versions of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (or
[io.js](https://iojs.org/en/index.html)) and npm. If you plan to run your
server with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), you'll need Docker and Docker
Compose installed (we provide Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml). On Mac OS X
you'll also need [boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/). If you wish to run the
server without Docker, you'll need access to a local or remotely accessible
[Redis](http://redis.io/) instance. Python, C/C++ compiler are needed on your
system for building native Nodejs packages, and OpenSSL is required to create
key pairs and certificates. In production, you'll also need a reverse proxy/
load balancer that handles SSL termination. We recommend [nginx](http://nginx.org/).

#### Install the CLI tools

```bash
$ npm install -g anvil-connect anvil-connect-cli
```


#### Generate your deployment repository

```bash
# Make a place for your project to live
$ mkdir path/to/project
$ cd path/to/project

# Generate a deployment repository
$ nvl init
? What would you like to name your Connect instance? myauthserver
? What (sub)domain will you use? connect.example.com
? Would you like to use Docker? Yes
? Would you like to run Redis? Yes
? Would you like to run nginx? Yes
? Would you like to create a self-signed SSL cert? Yes
? Country Name (2 letter code) US
? State or Province Name (full name) South Dakota
? Locality Name (eg, city) Rapid City
? Organization Name (eg, company) Anvil Research, Inc.
```

#### Running with Docker

Run docker-compose from the root of your new project.

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

#### Running without Docker

The first time, you'll need to install npm and bower dependencies.

```bash
$ cd connect
$ npm install && bower install
```

Then you can start the server in with `node` or `npm`.

```bash
# development mode
$ node server.js

# production mode
$ NODE_ENV=production node server.js
```
